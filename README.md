# Dictionary Entries Analysis

## Overview

The Dictionary Entries Analysis is a Python program designed to analyze and enhance user understanding of input text by providing insights into selected dictionary entries. The program interacts with users by replacing specific words in their input text with their corresponding definitions retrieved from a pre-defined dictionary dataset.

## Features

- **Word Selection**: The program randomly selects a limited number of words from the user's input text for which dictionary entries are analyzed.
- **Definition Retrieval**: For each selected word, the program looks up its definition in the loaded dictionary dataset.
- **Substitution**: The program replaces the selected words in the original input text with their corresponding definitions, providing insights into the dictionary entries and enhancing the user's understanding of the text.
- **Context Preservation**: The program ensures that the overall structure and coherence of the input text are maintained during the replacement process, preserving the logical flow of ideas.

## Benefits

- **Interactive Learning**: Users can input text and receive definitions for selected words, making it a helpful tool for learning new vocabulary.
- **Random Selection**: The program randomly selects words for which to provide definitions, offering variety in the learning experience.
- **Recursion**: The program employs recursion to provide definitions for words within the provided text, creating a deeper understanding of multiple words within the context of a sentence or paragraph.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the program by providing their own dictionary data, allowing for personalized learning experiences tailored to specific interests or subjects.

## Usage

1. **Input Text**: Provide the text for which dictionary entries are to be analyzed.
2. **Output**: The program will generate output text with selected words replaced by their corresponding dictionary entries.
3. **Interact**: Users can engage in a continuous interaction loop, inputting text and receiving insights into selected dictionary entries.
